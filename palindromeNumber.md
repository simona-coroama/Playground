# Setup

- Create a new solution in Visual Studio
- Add a new C# project with an appropriate name to the solution
- Add a new C# test project with an appropriate name to the solution

# Requirements
- Implement a function that determines whether an integer is a palindrome. A number is a palindrome if it reads the same backwards as forwards.
- Rules:
  - Negative numbers are not palindromes (due to the minus sign).
  - Single-digit numbers are palindromes.
- Add several test methods that validate your implementation for the created function.

# Examples

```
Input: 121 Output: true
Input: -121 Output: false
Input: 10 Output : false
Input: 0 Output: true
Input: 1221 Output: true
```
